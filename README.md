## üîÑ Switching Between Mock and Real Backends

The app chooses its data source at runtime using **Vite env variables**.

### 1) Set the mode in `.env`

Create (or edit) a `.env` in the project root:

```env
# --- MODE TOGGLE ---
# true  = run with in-memory mock data and a mock realtime event bus
# false = connect to a real REST API and a SignalR hub
VITE_USE_MOCK=true

# --- REAL MODE ENDPOINTS (required only if VITE_USE_MOCK=false) ---
# Base URL for the REST API (e.g., https://localhost:5001)
VITE_API_BASE=https://localhost:5001

# SignalR hub URL (e.g., https://localhost:5001/JobSignalRHub)
VITE_SIGNALR_HUB=https://localhost:5001/JobSignalRHub
